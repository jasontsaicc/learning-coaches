# learning-coaches

A Claude Code plugin providing a family of first-principles learning coaches built on a shared teaching engine. Each coach uses Feynman and Simon methods (incremental layering, asking you to articulate understanding, teaching by breaking down complex topics into foundational pieces) to guide deep learning in DevOps domains. Live coaches: Terraform/Infrastructure-as-Code, Kubernetes/SRE, System Design interview prep, and LeetCode coding-interview prep.

## Tracked Workspaces

`workspaces/` holds per-student learning state (progress file, registries, session log) and
is deliberately git-tracked: the student syncs it across machines by committing after each
session and pulling before the next. This differs from `skills/*/workspace/`, which stays
untracked scratch space. `portfolio/` is the curated, shareable output area; only artifacts
that clear the coach's quality bar land there.

Each workspace was merged in from standalone pre-monorepo repos (histories merged via git
subtree). `legacy/` holds frozen pre-merge snapshots; treat it and the `pre-migration`
archives as read-only.

| workspace | migrated from | originals kept in |
|---|---|---|
| k8s | `k8s-mastery-lab-skill` | `workspaces/k8s/archive/pre-migration/` |
| sd | `system-design-coach` + `system-design-notes` | `workspaces/sd/archive/pre-migration/` |
| leetcode | `leetcode-notes` (learner state) + `leetcode_coach` (teaching philosophy) | `workspaces/leetcode/archive/pre-migration/`, histories in `legacy/leetcode/` |

## Deployment and Lint

Live coaches run as user-level skills: each is symlinked into `~/.claude/skills/`, e.g.
`ln -s <repo>/skills/sd-coach ~/.claude/skills/sd-coach`. Currently deployed: k8s-coach,
sd-coach, leetcode-coach (terraform-coach is not symlinked). Local plugin testing:
`claude --plugin-dir <repo>`, reload with `/reload-plugins`.

Before commit: `./scripts/lint-all.sh` must pass (validates plugin manifest, engine, and
every coach; runs lab script tests). Scaffold a new coach with `./scripts/new-coach.sh
<name> [--no-lab] [--with-language] [--with-narrative]`; it fails lint until every TODO
marker is filled.

## Engine Read Mechanism

A coach reads the shared engine via `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../engine/ENGINE.md` (bash
injection), with markdown link `../../engine/ENGINE.md` as a human-readable backup.
`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` is the skill's own directory and resolves regardless of the session
working directory (per official Claude Code skills docs). `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` does not
exist for skills.
